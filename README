This file describes how to run the COMET script written by Jennifer Asimit during her time 
in the Metabolic Disease group led by InÃªs Barroso at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute.
COMET is an outcome from Jennifer's Medical Research Council Methodology Research fellowship (MR/K021486/1).


The analysis with COMET requires two R source files and one bash script (to run Plink). The files are called in the following sequence:
A) prep_COMET_general_script.R
B) clump-using-plink.sh
C) COMET_general_script.R

If a file of covariates (containing columns: SNP, BP, and a column for each covariate containing 1/0 for presence/absence of the SNP in the covariate category) 
is already at hand, the three scripts listed above are the only scripts that the user needs to call, 
but the other scripts are necessary for the main script to work properly.  The scripts are 
written such that all the scripts need to be in the same directory as the data so that they can be found. 
Note that in order to perform the clumping, a reference panel, such as from 1000 Genomes CEU, will be required. 

P-value implementation: The scripts are designed for an analysis using ABFs, but can easily be applied to p-values by creating a column called "ABF" containing the -log10(p-value) for each variant 
and setting R=1 and pi0=a/(1-a), where a=-log10(alpha). The reasoning for this is as follows.
The ABF threshold is found from:
PO <- pi0/(1-pi0) # prior odds of no association
theta <- PO/R
Then, setting R=1 and pi0=a/(1-a), where a=-log10(alpha), will carry out the analysis where variants are classified as
significant if -log10(p-value) > -log10(alpha), since with these settings, theta = a = -log10(alpha).
The logic for this is that the scripts are designed such that large ABF is higher evidence of association, so working with 
-log10(p-value) and changing the threshold accordingly will allow the script to run for evidence of association measured by p-values.

###
NOTE: The script for generating six VEP covariates from VEP output is also available: VEP-output-to-covariates.R
After running vep with the options --terms so --check_existing --regulatory, this R script may be run to convert the VEP output to 1/0 covariates for the categories:
Q1:SNP in a transcribed but not translated region
Q2:SNP in a translated region but does not change the amino acid
Q3:SNP is potentially deleterious (might disrupt protein)
Q4:SNP is potentially loss of function (might cause loss of function of protein) 
Q5:SNP is in a potentially regulatory or regulatory region
Q6:SNP is intergenic
Q7-Q10 are also output, which are different variants of some of the above covariates - see the VEP-output-to-covariates.R for precise definitions

The script VEP-output-to-covariates.R takes 2 arguments:
1) VEP output file (as input)
2) covariate output file name; this output file will contain 12 columns: SNP id (rs id if it exists or chr:BP), chr:BP, Q1,Q2,...,Q10

A) The first R script (prep_COMET_general_script.R) is needed to create a single file of the variants that exist for both traits, 
to calculate the Approximate Bayes' factors (ABFs) from the summary statistics for each trait (if needed), 
and then the joint measure for clumping in Plink. It is recommended to run this separately for each chromosome. 
This script takes 6 input parameters, where the input files are described in greater detail below:
1) Summary Statistics file for Trait 1 (details below)
2) Summary Statistics file for Trait 2 (details below) 
3) R: Ratio of type I error cost to type II error cost (R>1 gives a "discovery" mode and a value of R=20 is recommended for discovery)
4) pi0: Prior probability of an association at a SNP (pi0=0.99 is useful for discovery, as searching for shared variants and not genome-wide significant)
5) abf.calc: values are yes or no (case-sensitive), indicating whether ABFs need to be calculated from provided summary statistics (yes) or 
ABFs are already available and do not need to be calculated (no). If p-values are to be used, use "no" and use the settings described in the p-value implementation above. 
6) OUTtoclump.file: Main output file, will contain variants in both datasets, their marginal ABFs, and the joint ABF measure  needed for clumping 
7) cc: values are yes or no (case-sensitive), indicating whether data is case-control (yes) or quantitative trait (no)
8) trait1SE: set to 1 for all scenarios, unless doing QT analysis and trait is not standard normal nor inverse-rank normalised trait, in that case use an estimate of the trait's standard error 
9) trait2SE: set to 1 for all scenarios, unless doing QT analysis and trait is not standard normal nor inverse-rank normalised trait, in that case use an estimate of the trait's standard error 
10) chromosome number

The Summary Statistics Files for Traits 1 and 2 are each a tab-delimited file with one line per SNP. 
There is no need to order the SNPs in the files to match each other and it is fine to have SNPs that are present in only one file. 
The script will format appropriately and input varies according to whether or not ABFs need to be calculated.

If ABFs need to be calculated (abf.calc=TRUE)
The columns should be (there may be additional columns, but they will be ignored):
1) SNP	
2) BP	
3) REF	
4) ALT
5) Effect	
6) StdErr
7) P.value

If ABFs are already available and do not need to be calculated (abf.calc=FALSE)
The columns should be (there may be additional columns, but they will be ignored):
1) SNP	
2) BP	
3) REF	
4) ALT
5) ABF

The script is called in the following manner from the command line:

>R CMD BATCH '--args arg_1 arg_2 arg_3 arg_4 arg_5 arg_6 arg_7 arg_8 arg_9 arg_10' prep_COMET_general_script.R prep_COMET_general_script.Rout


B) It is recommended to run this separately for each chromosome. The bash script (clump-using-plink.sh) takes 2 input parameters:
1) OUTtoclump.file, which is output after running prep_COMET_general_script.R.
2) Reference Panel file name stub, in Plink binary format (e.g. file name stub of 1kg-ceu.bed, 1kg-ceu.bim, 1kg-ceu.fam is 1kg-ceu)
3) chromosome number 

The script is called in the following manner from the command line:

./clump-using-plink.sh arg_1 arg_2 arg_3

This script will output a gzipped file of approximately independent SNPs (have r^2 < 0.1), based on the joint association measures. 
The output file has name "Output1.file"-abf.clumped.gz. E.g. If Output1.file is called "Joint-measures.txt", 
then the output file will be "Joint-measures.txt-abf.clumped.gz"


C) This is the main analysis step of COMET and may be repeated for any subset(s) of covariates contained in the covariate file. 
The R script (COMET_general_script.R) takes as input the files created in the previous steps, as well as a covariate file. 
NOTE: As the model is fit quite quickly, if several models with different covariates from the file are to be considered, it is recommended to
run this R script interactively, reading in the files only once and then fitting the various models.

The 8 input parameters are:
1) zipped traits.file	(Concatenated chromosome output files from step (A), containing both traits)
2) R: Ratio of type I error cost to type II error cost (R>1 gives a "discovery" mode and a value of R=20 is recommended for discovery)
3) pi0: Prior probability of an association at a SNP (pi0=0.99 is useful for discovery, as searching for shared variants and not genome-wide significant)
4) zipped clumped.file: output file from step (B) clump-using-plink.sh: "Output1.file"-abf.clumped.gz
5) zipped covariate.file: file of covariate values for each SNP, containing columns: SNPid, SNP position, covariate values (1/0 for presence/absence in category)
6) covariate.names: within-quotes, comma-separated list of covariate names to be included in model; if the model is to include cov1,cov2,cov3,cov4,cov5 use format "cov1,cov2,cov3,cov4,cov5"
7) printsig: value 1 if significant overlap variants, their marginal statistics, and covariate values are to be output; 0 otherwise. If output, then filename is determined from the main.output.file: 
"main.output.file"-overlap-details.txt
8) main.output.file: COMET results for each marginal model and the overlap model (effect estimates, standard errors, p-values for positive enrichment, number of significant variants in category)


The script is called in the following manner from the command line:

>R CMD BATCH '--args arg_1 arg_2 arg_3 arg_4 arg_5 arg_6 arg_7 arg_8' COMET_general_script.R COMET_general_script.Rout
